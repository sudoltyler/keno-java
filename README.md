# Keno Game - *Spring 2022*
Replication of the lottery game Keno in Java. The program features a start screen,
when the player selects start game, the game screen is shown. The game is then
played by selecting a number of tiles, and a number of drawings to play. Once
selections were made, or the player chose to select randomly, the player can start
the draw, where numbers are randomly selected. If the random draw matches any of
the player's selections, they earn a select amount of winnings. After all draws,
there is an option to start a new game. There's a game menu in the upper left 
corner, which allows the player to view the rules, odds, or exit the game.
